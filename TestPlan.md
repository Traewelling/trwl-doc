## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software.
This Test Plan for Tr√§welling supports the following objectives:

- Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.
- Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
- Outlines the testing approach that will be used.
- Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2 Scope

This document describes the used tests, as well as the testing workflow. We use Code quality Tests, Unit Tests and Feature Tests. Additionally, the code is reviewed by another member of the team each PR as well as an external code quality measurement tool.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is intended for internal use primarily. Further, this document will be handed in at the end of the semester and is posted on our Blog.

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation
### 2.1 Background
Testing serves to ensure that the written code does what it is intended to do. It also prevents future code changes to break existing functionality unnoticed. In the context of integration it can also prevent broken software states to be merged into secured VC branches

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission
The mission of this test plan is to prevent errors in production, find possible security risks and ensure an outstanding software quality.

### 2.3 Test Motivators
Our testing is motivated by
- quality risks
- technical risks
- use cases
- functional requirements

## 3. Target Test Items

The listing below identifies those test items (software, hardware, and supporting product elements) that have been identified as targets for testing.
This list represents what items will be tested.

Items for Testing:
- PHP Backend
- PHP (Blade) Frontend
- PHP API (JSON, REST)

## 4. Outline of Planned Tests

### 4.1 Outline of Test Inclusions
Testing static functions with UnitTests.
Testing everything else with Feature Tests.

### 4.2 Outline of Other Candidates for Potential Inclusion
Stress Testing the application and its servers. Findung security breaches.

### 4.3 Outline of Test Exclusions
Most tests require a functioning backend to the HAFAS-API. Since we have to test trains, that are travelling right now,
we need to ensure non-breaking tests around the clock. At some times of the day, there is virtually no public transport,
so we need to skip these tests if no applicable train is found (e.g. at night).
